Entity annotation Documentation 
Entity type description 
>. Structure such as neural system .
>. Material we can give an example of magnetic material. 
>. Methods like the neural circuit .
>. Features let's say performance and advantages.
>. Functional for example we only make the function of the entire invention. 
>. Energy which includes incorporating both physical energy and related quantities .
>. Matter mata is categorized into three states of matter that is solid liquid and gas .
>. Information which includes the signals data and numeric values that are being incorporated into the 
entity annotation. 
>. Problems the includes the defects for example large charge densities. 
>. Attributes The attributes includes conductive structures such as surface of a material.
>. Operation like progress stage and instructions 
>. Application of the entire entity annotation according to the specified data or rules and where it's 
being applied in real life situation using the concept of data annotation.
For the first instructions provide, now let's define the hiracle ontologies for entity types relation ,bypass 
relation types, event types and attribute based on the ACE'05 entity definitions and the categories 
provided now let's define the annotation from each subsection starting with entities.
Let's define the hierarchical ontologies for entity types, relation types, event types, and attributes based 
on the ACE'05 entity definitions and the categories provided in your assignment instructions. I'll create a 
structured format for each category:
[entities]
# Physical entities
structure
material
substance
# Conceptual entities
function
scientific concept
information
energy
# Method entities
method
operation
interaction
# Characteristics
features_performance_advantages
attributes
state
# Situational entities
application_scenarios
problem
question
# Other entities
task
2.Relation :Now they define how the entity annotation are related to each other
[relations]
# Spatial relations
located_at
adjacent_to
part_of
# Causal relations
causes
leads_to
prevents
# Temporal relations
before
after
simultaneous
# Functional relations
used_for
dependent_on
# Attributional relations
has_attribute
characterized_by.
3. Events; they define action or the occurances involving entity 
[events]
# Method-related events
implementation
execution
application
# Material-related events
creation
modification
combination
# Functional events
operation
performance
failure
# Situational events
occurrence
detection
identification
4.Attributes ;they describe the characteristics of each entities. 
[attributes]
# Structural attributes
size
shape
color
material
# Performance attributes
efficiency
speed
accuracy
# State attributes
status
condition
state
# Quantitative attributes
value
quantity
level
These are the required structure or the layout of what is required for the documentation of the entity 
annotation.
